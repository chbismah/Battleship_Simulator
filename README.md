# Battleship Simulator (C++)

A console-based **Battleship game** developed in **C++**, implementing core programming concepts such as arrays, functions, loops, conditionals, and basic game logic.  
The game supports **turn-based gameplay** with ship placement, hit/miss detection, and win conditions.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates the classic **Battleship game** in a text-based console environment.  
Players take turns attacking coordinates on a grid until all ships of one player are destroyed.

The project was built to strengthen understanding of:
- 2D arrays
- Modular programming
- Game logic implementation
- User input handling
- Console-based interaction

## 🎮 Features

- 10×10 game board using 2D arrays
- Ship placement on the board
- Turn-based attack system
- Hit (`X`) and Miss (`O`) detection
- Ship sinking logic
- Win condition detection
- Console screen clearing for better gameplay experience
